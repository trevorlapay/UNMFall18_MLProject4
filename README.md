## Setup

Go to the [Human Protein Atlas Image Classification competition on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/human-protein-atlas-image-classification). Download all the data (a zip archive titled "all.zip") to the root directory of the project. Extract the archive including all sub-folders (test/, train/).

This version uses ImageDataGenerator, which requires all classes of images grouped in respective directories. The code to do this is pending.
